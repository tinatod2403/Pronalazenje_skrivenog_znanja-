This project focuses on building a system for collecting and analyzing data on books available in Serbia. The goal is to develop a web indexer and parser that automatically gathers relevant information from specific websites like Laguna, Vulkan, and others. The collected data is stored in a relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) with at least 20,000 records.

The project is divided into several tasks:

Data Collection: Develop a web indexer and parser to extract and store book information such as title, author, publisher, publication year, genre, format, price, etc.

Data Analysis: Process and filter the data, generate reports on the number of books by category, publisher, year of publication, and create rankings for the most expensive books.

Data Visualization: Display the analysis results using charts, including publisher representation, price distribution, formats, and genres.

Regression Implementation: Build a multiple linear regression model to predict book prices based on features like author, genre, and number of pages.

Classification Implementation: Apply logistic regression to classify book prices into predefined price ranges using binary and multi-class classification methods.

Clustering Implementation: Use the K-means algorithm to group books based on key attributes.
